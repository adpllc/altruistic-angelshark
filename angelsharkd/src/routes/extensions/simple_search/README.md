# Angelshark Simple Extension Search

This extension implements very simple extension searching for end users. It allows for multi-keyword searches on a pre-downloaded collection of CM extension-type and station data. This data can be refreshed on-demand or periodically. Searches always return immediately, even when no data has been downloaded yet.
